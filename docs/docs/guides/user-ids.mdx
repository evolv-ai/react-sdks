# User IDs
The `<EvolvProvider />` requires a `uid` prop to identify the current user, to allocate a variant to that user
consistently, and to correlate the user's activity with the allocated variant. In order to be agnostic as to how
the UID is persisted, the SDKs do not automatically generate a user ID. And therefore, your application must generate
and provide its own UID to the `<EvolvProvider />`.

Example strategies of how to generate and persist UIDs can be found here:

* [NextJS Application](https://github.com/evolv-ai/react-sdks/tree/main/examples/nextjs/src/utils/uid.ts)
